# C++ pandas
This project is for me to practice using the new features of modern C++, by re-implementing a few functionalities of [pandas](https://pandas.pydata.org/) - Python Data Analysis Library. The goal of using as many C++14/17/20 features as possible is inspired by Jonathan Boccara's blog post [The Expressive C++17 Coding Challenge](https://www.fluentcpp.com/2017/09/25/expressive-cpp17-coding-challenge/).

### C++20 core language features
- init-statements for range-based for

### C++17 core language features
